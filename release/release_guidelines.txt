Release Guidelines
------------------

These are a few notes of what should probably go into a precompiled release:

* nel executable in the base folder.
* release/readme.txt as readme.txt in the base folder.
* tools/ folder.
* tests/ folder.

Oh yeah, release/readme.txt and readme.md have different purposes:

* readme.md is for the Github description of the repository, aimed at people who
  want to develop the nel compiler's source. The formatting is markdown.
* release/readme.txt is meant to be a summary of the program itself, and is
  targetted more at an end-user assembly programmer. The formatting is meant
  to look good in plain-text, not targetted at a particular markup style,
  because it's only meant to be rendered as plain-text.
  
  It should render fine in 80 character displays without word-wrap.

That's probably good for now.
